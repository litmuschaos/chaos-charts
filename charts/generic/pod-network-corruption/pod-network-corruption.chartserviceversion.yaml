  categoryDescription: |
    Pod-network-corruption contains chaos to disrupt network connectivity to kubernetes pods. Experiments can inject percentage packet corruption on the app replica pods. 
    - Causes packet corruption of application replica by injecting packet corruption using pumba.
    - The application pod should be healthy once chaos is stopped. Service-requests should be served (say, via alternate replicas) despite chaos.
